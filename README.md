# ScrollJs 

ScrollJs is a lightweight and easy to use javascript library that allows you to add scroll triggered animations (AOS) with optional callback functions and also lazy load your images to make your website more optimize.

While other scroll triggered animation library offer predefined animation classes not giving full control and how you want your animations to display, ScrollJs allows you to use your already styled animation class.
